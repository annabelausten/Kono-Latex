\subsection{fo + ami, proper long distance, no scope marking}

\exg. kàì á fɔ̀-ì-jé bòndú á fèn sàŋ kùnù.\\
Kai 3SG.PST say-2SG-to Bondu 3SG.PST what buy yesterday\\
`Kai told you what Bondu bought yesterday' \jf{(NOT A QUESTION - Per Tony, could be a response to a question)} \\

\exg. kàì á fɔ̀-ì-jé bòndú á fènè sàŋ kùnù.\\
Kai 3SG.PST say-2SG-to Bondu 3SG.PST something buy yesterday\\
`Kai told you that Bondu bought something yesterday' \jf{(Unlike with "ami" you can have both fen and fene embedded here.)} \\

Kai 3SG.PST what hear Bondu 3SG.PST what buy yesterday\\
`What did Kai hear that Bondu bought yesterday?' \jf{(Tony corrected me - no "m" at end of "ami" - YES QUESTION)}\\

\jf{If above is okay, and is a question, check answer:}

\exg.  Kàì á àmí bòndú á fèn sã̀  kùnù\\
Kai 3SG.PST hear Bondu 3SG.PST what buy yesterday\\
`?Kai heard regarding what Bondu bought yesterday.' \jf{This was corrected to the above example, but seemed to maybe work on a marginal or infelicitous level.}\\


\subsection{Long-distance questions with think and ask:}

\subsubsection{Reconfirm that the following are questions:}

\exg. kàì á j-ɔ̀ tìsá bòndú á fèn sàŋ kùnù\\
Kai 3SG.PST 2SG-OBJ ask Bondu 3SG.PST what buy yesterday\\
`Kai asked you what Bondu bought yesterday.' \jf{(Statement, not Q)}\\  


\exg. kàì á j-ɔ̀ tìsá káàmá bòndú á fèn sàŋ kùnù\\

\section{Mingyang}
\subsection{More on anaphoric ã}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can ã be used with negation?
    \exg. Kàn t͡ʃɛ̀ mwè kànt͡ʃɛ̀tɛ̀á ã kàt͡ʃɛ̀mwét͡ʃɛ̀ Bondu má sõ\\
    (Needs glossing)
    `There is a teacher in the place of learning. Bondu doesn't know the teacher.'

    \exg. kamwe\\
    `teacher'

    \exg. kant͡ʃɛ̀mwé\\
    `teacher'
    

    \item Can ã be used with a plural NP?
   
    \exg. (Kan t͡ʃɛ mwenu ) kamwenu ambe kan t͡ʃɛ tɛa, ã kamwenu ambi si-o gba\\
    (needs glossing)
    `There are several teachers in the place of learning. The teachers are sitting in the back.'

    \exg. an kamwet͡ʃɛ̀nu ambi si-o gba\jf{Also acceptable for the above part of this statement}

    \exg. kamwet͡ʃɛ̀nu ambe si-o gba\jf{Can say if the person is present, but 't͡ʃɛ̀' can be misleading if no one's there}

    \item Can ã be used with a relative clause?\\
    Two situations - 1) Bondu has prior knowledge of the cassava leaves in the pot and 2) Bondu has no idea that there are cassava leaves in the pot.
    
    \exg. Bondu, na tàŋgùmbà t͡ʃɛ̀ná  dao (Adapted from Arkoh 2011)
    (Needs Glossing)
    `Bondu, bring the cassava leaves that are in the pot.'

    \exg. Bondu, ná tàŋgùmbànà mimbi dao (Adapted from Arkoh 2011)
    (Needs Glossing)
    `Bondu, bring the cassava leaves that are in the pot.'

    \exg. Bondu, ná tàŋgùmbà t͡ʃɛ̀ná mimbi dao (Adapted from Arkoh 2011)
    (Needs Glossing)
    `Bondu, bring the cassava leaves that are in the pot.'
\jf{Wouldn't use ã here because it's just one statement }

\exg. ã tàŋgùmbànu an tawá
(needs glossing)
` And thos cassava leaves, I want you to cook  them'

\jf{ Example of when you would use ã when readdressing and stating in an additional statement}


\exg. woo\\
`stupid, crazy'

\exg. áimà má-tɛni\\
`stupid'

    \item Can ã be used with epithet definites?
    \exg.   Bondu náná t͡ʃɛná áwumwet͡ʃɛ, \\
    (Needs Glossing)
`Bondu came to my house. That idiot broke my pot.'
\jf{ Anthony started this ways, but didn't finish because wanted to make the phrase exact/very specific}
    
    \exg. Woomo Bondu anana t͡ʃɛná áwumwet͡ʃɛ ana dao o te  (Adapted from Ahn \& Schwarz 2023)
    `Bondu came to my house. That idiot broke my pot.'

    \exg. Bondu nàná t͡ʃɛná áwumwe ana dao o te\\
\jf{ More generalized version of "that crazy person broke my pot", but could be misleading, maybe refers to Bondu maybe not}

\exg. Woomo Bondu anana t͡ʃɛná o mwet͡ʃɛ ana dao o te\\
(needs glossing)
 `Bondu came to my house. That idiot broke my pot.'
 \jf{ Also acceptable variation}


\exg. O mwe na dao o te\\
(needs glossing)
`Stupid person broke my pot'

\exg. Bondu nana t͡ʃɛná. O mwená dao o te\\
(Needs glossing)
` Bondu came to my house. That idiot broke my pot.'
\jf{ Two statements w/ nothing connecting them. The 'ã' is what connects them}
     
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Situation-based co-variation}
   \ex. (Adapted from Jenks \& Konate 2022)\\
    \textit{Context: It is well known that chiefs are mean and grumpy people.}\\
    `In all the villages, the people don’t like the chief.'
\exg. Kongat͡ʃɛ n'beo mwe má-tuni-ana masa
(Needs glossing)
`In all the villages, the people don't like their chiefs'

\exg. mwemimibe kongat͡ʃi nbeo amatuni ana mansa 
(Needs glossing)
`In all the villages, the people don't like their chiefs'
\jf{ Wouldn't use t͡ʃɛ in this case unless pointing at the person}

\exg. ã masat͡ʃɛ nu anongoseeo
(Needs glossing)
`Those chiefs look at them sitting there.'
\jf{ Example of how you'd connect with ã the statement above using ã}

\exg. mwemimbe (m'bikongot͡ʃo) m'bikongot͡ʃɛndo ama tuni masant͡ʃa, an masant͡ʃɛ aka baiama-wã\\
(Needs Glossing)

`All the people in those villages, they don't like this chief. That chief is from Baiama.'

\exg. B\`{o}nd\'{u} \`{a} k\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e}-gb\'{e} jẽ́ẽ́. \\

`Bondu saw all categories of students.'


\chs{It appears that no clear variable binding is found, as the negation comes from the clausal negator and the pronoun is plural, which may be confused with coreference.} \newline

`No student\textit{\scriptsize{i}} saw (his\textit{\scriptsize{i}}) mother.' \chs{I am not so sure about this sentence, because Tony seemed to take  k\`{a}ṍkã̀  away when he was explaining the difference with the plural one.}

student all.category NEG -3PL.SER1-mother see-NEG \\
`All categories of students\textit{\scriptsize{i}} did not see their\textit{\scriptsize{i}} mother.' \chs{Maybe this is not a good example for variable binding as the negation is the clausal negator instead of the negative quantifier, and thus it has some chance of being interpreted as co-reference?}

\alex{\ref{26890} is good evidence for an intervening morpheme between the subject pronoun and the non-past auxiliary. If there was nothing intervening, we would expect [3PL-NPST] = [an-(w)e] = [ambe]. Instead, we get [an-ɛɛ].}

\alex{\ref{17800} is interesting, since there does not seem to be any overt intervener between the subject pronoun and the `ni' auxiliary. Not sure what to say about this, especially in light of my observation/comment for \ref{26890}.}

\alex{\ref{31232} is exactly the kind of example I've been looking for, where the a- object marker clearly occurs before the auxiliary. This example presents an interesting contrast with \ref{17800}, where we don't see the intervening object marker. Not sure what to make of this variability yet. Nonetheless, \ref{31232} is good evidence for something.}
